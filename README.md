My [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) solutions

These are quick, dirty, hacky solutions. I approached the problems as "do it once and forget it existed", so no
quality should be expected.

I also used external libraries. I don't have time or energy after 10-hour workdays to reimplement existing
algorithms.

AI was not used. I didn't reference other people's solutions either. The exceptions are Day 10 part 2 and Day 12
part 1.

<summary>Spoiler warning for Day 10 part 2</summary>

Day 10 part 2 was the hardest, in my opinion. I couldn't figure it out. I had never used any mixed integer linear
programming modeller before. I have to admit I relied on AI to help me figure it out.

<summary>Spoiler warning for Day 12 part 1</summary>

For Day 12, I started with parsing, then applied obvious elimination before brute force... Then I looked for
libraries that could help with the packing problem... Only to discover that it already "solved" the problem.
